# 9Clock 
Bring back the iOS 9 clock to iOS 10 - 10.3.3
Currently the code is a mess and only works on iOS 10.
I think Apple changed methods with iOS 11 so it may not work the same.

Anyways I started this project just for fun and I don't have time to complete it so here it is for other's to learn and maybe improve on?
